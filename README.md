Application is calculating angles between two important points on the body to check if the exercise was done correctly. It also uses a simple to understand *red/yellow/green* palette of colours to inform the user about exercise progress. After correct repetition of the exercise, application updates the counter. In the main menu exercises are marked with simple images with colour coded, interactive backgrounds. Skeleton with markers only shows body parts important for chosen exercise.
